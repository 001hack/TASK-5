# TASK-5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark in Kali

👋 **Hello GitHub Fam!**  
This is my **5th task** as a **Cybersecurity Intern** with **Elevate Labs**. 
In this task, I captured and analyzed live network traffic to identify basic protocols and traffic types.

---

## Objective: 🎯

Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types using **Wireshark**.

---

## Tools: 🛠️

- **Wireshark** (Free and Open-Source)

---

## Deliverables: 📁

- A **.pcap** file containing captured packets.
- A **short report** summarizing the protocols identified.

---

## Hints/Mini Guide: 📚

1. **Install Wireshark** on Kali Linux.  
   (Already pre-installed on Kali, but you can install it manually using the following command if needed: `sudo apt install wireshark`)

2. **Start capturing** on your active network interface.  
   (e.g., `eth0` for wired connections, `wlan0` for wireless)

3. **Browse a website** or **ping a server** to generate traffic.  
   (e.g., Visit `https://www.google.com` or run `ping google.com` in the terminal)

4. **Stop the capture** after **1 minute**.

5. **Filter captured packets** by protocol (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP).  
   (Use filters like `http`, `dns`, `tcp` in Wireshark's filter bar)

6. **Identify at least 3 different protocols** in the capture.  
   (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP, ARP, ICMP)

7. **Export the capture** as a `.pcap` file.

8. **Summarize your findings** and **packet details**.

---

## Outcome: 🌟

- Gained hands-on experience with packet analysis.
- Improved protocol awareness and learned how to use Wireshark to filter and analyze live network traffic.

---

## Notes: 📝

- **Wireshark** is a powerful tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic in real time.
- Filters help you narrow down the captured data to focus on specific protocols or activities, making analysis easier.
- `.pcap` files can be shared and opened in Wireshark for further analysis or for collaboration with other cybersecurity professionals.

## Conclusion: ✅

This task helped me get hands-on experience with packet analysis and understand how to capture network traffic using **Wireshark**. It also improved my understanding of basic network protocols.
